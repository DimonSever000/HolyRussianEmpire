 bookmark_rise_of_mamluks_desc:0 "The Byzantine Empire is in decline, ruined by the Orthodox crusaders, who have not been able to achieve their goal - the liberation of the holy land. The Mamluk Sultanate is at the height of its power, threatening Europe. The Holy Russian Empire is divided and practically cannot influence the unfolding events. The nomads are defeated but not destroyed and are preparing revenge, and the exiled Polovtsians are preparing to take advantage of the situation and leave the empire. Western Europe unites in a second coalition and tries to stop the growing power of France. France is fighting for control of the territory. There are rumors of a coup d'état."
